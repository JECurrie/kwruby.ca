kwruby.ca website
=================

To run the site locally you will need [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and [Bundler](http://bundler.io/) installed.

Then execute the following:

1. bundle exec
2. middleman server
3. and follow the instructions for connecting

Backlog
=======
* add events to the site and then events with Meetup
  - https://github.com/boscomonkey/meetup_api
  - would also need to pull RSVPs back into the middleman site
  - and eventually build an RSVP interface on the site itself
